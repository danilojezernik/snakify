"""
Chess king moves horizontally, vertically or diagonally to any adjacent cell.
Given two different cells of the chessboard, determine whether a king can go from the first cell to the second in one move.

The program receives the input of four numbers from 1 to 8, each specifying the column and row number,
first two - for the first cell, and then the last two - for the second cell.
The program should output YES if a king can go from the first cell to the second in one move, or NO otherwise.
